# Web Font Exhibition

The goal of this document is mainly to be a tasklist for me not to forget to make this app better.    

## Technical Todos


- we have to ensure the fonts will stay cached in the client computer, and if we could, avoid them being deleted when we clear the browser cache. Maybe working with HTML5 Cache...


### Minifying css/js
The CSS and JS files must be minified/packed before including them.


## Design Todos

### The Ugly Css
The CSS is quite ugly...
#### Rewrite it more cleanly (with Sass)

#### Implementing some other functions
We could build a lightweight jquery plugin to allow the user to change the line-height, the gap between headers, the font  weightsâ€¦ but still respecting the vertical rythm
