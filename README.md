# Web Font Specimen Server

[Web Font Specimen](http://wfs.typographisme.net/) is a very lightweight tool helping any designer who uses type to check any font properties in a really simple and fast way.  

[Web Font Exhibition](http://superbiche.me/projects/webfontexhibition) is just aimed at people having a PHP server on their machine or elsewhere, who need to check **loads** of fonts - just like me at this time.  
In addition, the @font-face technique used is not using the .otf format, but instead uses either **the ttf/otf** if it's the only format available or **the font-face stack** (eot, ttf, svg, woff) if it's found.  
By **saving** the directory structure of the selected Fonts directory in a **SQLite3** database, it avoids parsing the directory structure on each reload.  
Finally, the fonts are **lazy-loaded**, and a **preview** is available from the select menu.  

_**For people who don't like PHP**, you can simply use [Web Font Specimen](http://wfs.typographisme.net/) coupled with [FontFrient](http://somadesign.ca/projects/fontfriend/), an incredibly useful bookmarklet that allows you to change your page's font by simply dragging it in a zone. But that's not the point._

## How to

### Installation

Extract the content of the archive if needed, then simply move the folder anywhere under your webserver document root.  
While it's not essential, I recommend setting a virtual host. Nice web typography deserves at least a host, you lazy!

#### Linking to the fonts
##### Directory structure
The easiest way to use WebFontExhibition is **creating a symlink** to a folder containing all your fonts or subfolders in which fonts can be found.  
It can be like in the following examples :  

* Simple folder containing both fonts and font folders  
-`Fonts`	
++++`OpenSans`  
------`Arial(huh)`  
---------------`ArialBold.ttf`

* Folder ordered by type … type  
-`Fonts`	
++++`Handwritten`  
------`Serif`  
---------------`JustOldFashion`  
------------------------------------`JustOldFashion.ttf`

* If you find some folder structures that are not read correctly, please make a pull request if you think you can fix it, or post an issue in this project's Github. I'll fix it ASAP.

##### Linking 
* __Mac OS X users, as well as Linux users, can make a link to their Fonts folder in the terminal by typing : __  
	`ln -s [/path/to/your/fonts/folder] [/path/to/web-font-specimen-server/root/Fonts]`  
	_(the second path must be the same that the index.php file)_  
	For me, it was : `ln -s ~/Fonts/Web ~/www/tools/WebFontSpecimenServer/htdocs/Fonts`  
	
* __Windows users have to build a symlink using [this tutorial](http://www.simounet.net/creation-de-liens-symboliques-sous-windows-7-symlink/)__ (_in french_).  
If you can't read french, go to [this page on How-To Geek](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/) _(didn't test this one)_


#### Setting the config file
Just open the /inc/config.inc.php file and set config.fonts.directory to the right location, regarding your document root (_will be `/Fonts` for me. I use dotted notation as this project is part of a framework project using this config notation_)



### Enjoy the beauty of type and the power of PHP+javascript
Now you're done! Just go with your browser to the right page, and you should see something really similar to Web Font Specimen, with just one exception: the select menu allows you to **dynamically change the font you're watching**, but also to **see a preview of all the fonts**. Voilà !
